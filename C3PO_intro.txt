# introduction for C3PO 
	C3PO is a conserved, multisubunit complex of the RNA-binding protein TRANSLIN (TSN) and 
	TRANSLIN-ASSOCIATED PROTIEN (TSNAX). Both members of the complex contain a previously 
	undescirbed RNA recognition motif (RRM). TSNAX is an endonuclease with a preference
	for single stranded RNA (ssRNA). 
	TSN and TSNAX form an octameric oblong complex and have been associated with various
	functions ranging from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) 
	damage response, RNA interference enhancement and neurologic development. 
	
	Recent biochemical and genetic studies, though, failed to identify a contribution of 
	C3PO to RNAi enhancement in fungi and mice. Instead, it was observed that upon C3PO 
	knockdown, there was an accumulation of premature tRNA fragment accumulation in 
	both species. 

	However, the stage in the tRNA lifecycle that C3PO participates remains unclear. 	
	We decided to examine the involvement of C3PO as a novel tRNA processing factor. 
	At the same time the RNA targets of C3PO is still elusive.
	
	We carried out Photoactivatable Riboucleoside Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation
	followed by high throughput sequencing (PAR-CLIP) to identify the transcriptome-wide 
	targets of C3PO. We performed PAR-CLIP on inducible cell lines expressing FLAG-HA TSN, 
	and FLAG-HA-TSN-2A-TSNAX*-HA. TSNAX* has an active site mutation because induction of 
	catalytically active TSNAX proved lethal in our system (data not shown). Both ORFs were cloned
	in tandem in order to control as tightly as possible their concomitant expression. 
	
	We show that C3PO binds to a WGGW motif (W= A or T) in tRNAs and mRNAs. Strikingly, 
	virtually no binding to miRNAs was observed, calling into into question the contribution
	of C3PO to RNAi. 
	
	In vitro biochemical cleavage assays with recombinant human C3PO show that C3PO exhibits 
	a length- and structure-dependent specificity. Its activity drops when its substrates' \
	length exceeds 80 nts. 
	
	At the same time, although C3PO processively degrades unstructured substrates (poly-rArC), 
	it presents a structural-dependence. 
	
	***give importance of proper function of C3PO by mentioning the phenotype of knockout 
	mice and/or fungi. 
	
	***tissue-specificity of expression: C3PO is expressed at moderate to high levels in 
	a variety of tissues. ***
	
#results
	describe PAR-CLIP results 
	effects of knockdown on the abundance of targets and non-targets
	
	co-IPs: they did not show a tight interaction with other proteins under even low salt
	conditions (***look-up javier s use of DSP***). 
	
	we examine globally the function of C3PO by generating stable HEK293 cell lines expressing 
	FLAG/HA tagged TSN and FLAG-HA-TSN-2A-TSNAX*-HA. 
	
	TSNAX* has an active site mutation because induction of 
	catalytically active TSNAX proved lethal in our system (data not shown).
	
	Ribonucleoprtein complexes were UV-crosslinked (365 nm), RNase treated, radiolabeled, 
	immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG aantibody, and resolved by SDS PAGE. In the context 
	of FH-TSN one band was observed at the expected size, when blotting with anti-HA antibody. 
	
	In the context of C3PO cell line, 3 bands were observed, corresponding to HA-tagged TSN, 
	HA-tagged TSNAX* and the remaining uncleaved TSN-2A intein-TSNAX peptide. 
	
	Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were created from both PAR-CLIP experiments and 
	Illumina sequenced. Sequence reads were aligned to an in-house reference transcriptome,
	and the human genome (hg19). Aligned reads were grouped by PARalyzer to identify clusters
	of overlapping sequences. In order to distinguish binding sites from background clusters, 
	we require that clusters fulfill three criteria: a) they had at least 50 reads with T-to-C conversions, 
	2) they contained at least 2 crosslinked sites, 3) had a frequency of â‰¥50% T-to-C cnversion. 
	
	We identified a total of XXXX and YYYY binding sites in the respective experiments. 
	The percentage of crosslinked sites that were identified as binding sites was particularly high 
	suggesting significant depletion of contaminating background reads in our experiments. 
	
	***of note, there was a high enrichment of tRNA clusters that were not observed before
	in the study of other RBPs (cite PAR-CLIP, Cell 2010) 
	
	
	
	***the clusters distributed through XXXX mRNAs and YYYY tRNA genes.
	previous gentic evidence and our PAR-CLIP results taken together, suggest that C3PO 
	might be a tRNA binding protein (tRBP). Since there are X times more mRNA reference transcripts 
	than tRNA genes, we suspected that tRNA binding sites might be underestimated. Thus, we 
	focused on the 100???? most abundant clusters based on read count, as well as 
	the most abundant clusters that collect 75% of the sequence reads. 
	
	tRNA transcripts undergo an extensive posttranscriptional processing and modification
	including 5' and 3' endonucleolytic cleavage, intron removal, 3' terminal CCA addition, 
	and chemical modifications. Due to all these, many reads that arise from tRNAs do not map 
	perfectly to the genomic sequences they are derived from or are not even considered due to the 
	deafault alignment criteria used during the analysis. 
	
	To overcome this we made use of a tRNA annotation and curation atlas to identify the true 
	binding sites of C3PO on tRNAs. This included both mature transcripts as well as 
	primary transcripts that contain the 5' leader adn 3' trailer sequences. C3PO binds exclusively 
	mature tRNAs after their endonucleolytic processing. It does not bind 5' leader, 3' trailer or 
	intronic sequences. Thus, we conclude that C3PO is a mature tRNA binding protein. 
	
	***motif analysis
		-motif prediction algorithms identified WGGW as the most likely motif both on 
		tRNAs and mRNAs. Interestingly, the motif is universally located in the D loop 
		of tRNAs. Therefore, it is unclear whether C3PO has a sequence or structural 
		recognition tRNA motif. To further evaluate the strength of the predicted motif 
		we counted all possible 4-mers revealed UGGU as the most abundant 4-mer and 
		exhibited an extremely high enrichment of G-rich and GU-rich sequences.
	
	
	***lookup the localization of C3PO 	
	
	
	***distribution of clusters on mRNAs
		C3PO binding sites on mRNAs are preferentially located on 5' UTRs which is not 
		common for most well-studied RBPs.
